      As someone who loves to work on side projects, Iâ€™ve always had a love hate
      relationship with GitHub. GitHub is a place where you can put on many
      kinds of hats. You can be a lone coder putting up personal websites, a
      regular contributor to an open source project that is business critical
      for top tech companies, a student collaborating with peers on a grad
      school project, a professional software engineer maintaining open sourced
      projects, or your average Joe lurker.

      There&apos;s a place for everyone, but using GitHub isn&apos;t the
      friendliest experience for everyone. When I used it for my projects, I was
      jumping between tabs, repositories, getting lost in my branches, etc. and
      I wished there was a more streamlined process for working with a fairly
      popular platform used by millions.

      I started Chummy to address my own pain points with GitHub, but it has
      become a collection of features that I&apos;ve had requested from friends
      and coworkers who&apos;ve validated my own frustrations with GitHub.
      Chummy&apos;s a continuously growing toolbox, so please leave some
      feedback so that we can make GitHub work for you.

      Thank you, and enjoy Chummy!

# Developer Questions

_What is your role in this project?_

Lead Developer

_What is the one thing we must get right to make this project worth undertaking?_

User experience is the primary focus. This extension must be easy to adopt and use in users' current workflows.

_How will you, personally, define success for this project?_

Being able to iterate quickly on user feedback with customer obsession.

_Who are the biggest competitors and what worries you about them?_

Octotree. They already have a huge userbase and a ton of credibility. I worry it will be hard to convince passionate Octotree users to switch over.

_How do you expect to differentiate this product?_

More features. More plugins and integrations with other tools.

_Where do you want the product to be in the next year, 5 years?_

A comprehensive suite of Github extensions/plug-ins that adds value to the user's experience.

_What keeps you up at night with regards to your users?_

That someday Github will change the look of their page drastically or deprecate an API, which will completely break the functionality of the extension.

_What assumptions do you think you are making about your users?_

I may be developing some features that users don't necessarily need. That users want a plug-and-play extension in the first place. Will this add bulk to the core of the extension?

_What do you know for sure about your users?_

Users who use Github extensively will find repetitive tasks that would benefit from tooling or a better UX.

_What are the most common problems your users face?_

Tedious work.

_What worries you about this project?_

That the scope is too small.

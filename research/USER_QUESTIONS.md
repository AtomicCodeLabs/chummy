## Stakeholder Questions

_How many hours per week do you spend on Github?_

_What do you use Github the most for?_

_Which page do you spend the most time on?_

_What are some repetitive tasks you find yourself having to do?_

_Do you use other Github extensions?_

_How do you currently go about exploring the contents of a repository?_

_Tell me about the last time you tried to contribute to an **open** source project._

_What is the biggest pain point with the website?_

_Is there any other question you wish I asked?_

## Product UX Questions

What are you thinking when you first sign in? What stands out to you?

What's your first impression of the extension?

- It's pretty

Where do you start?

What would keep you from using this project? In other words, what turns you off?

How would you go about opening a file?

- Opening new tab, active

How would you go about bookmarking/unbookmarking a file?

Try opening another repository?

- Can't do it from extension
- When opening a repository, had to click on file to update files in repository
- Clicking on main body of repository in open tabs should jump to most recent repository.

How would you go about searching for code in a repository?

- thought it was case sensitive
- not indexed
- search intuitively for flename
- filename is more important
- Fix search results descriptor for in:path search
- search for repositories

Is searching from the search and bookmark pages intuitive?

- when I click search result, open in current tab (should be consistent with explorer section)

How would you send feedback?

- intuitive

Try out all the settings in the settings page. What is the easiest setting to use? What is the hardest to understand?

How would you log out?

Was the interface easy to understand?

- a little biased bc you've seen it before

What if file is deleted
Other pages not being removed
Main window doesn't sync up with left on active
Jump to file that's open

- Extension is only one direction

Where did window go?

- In windows, it has own icon

Compact not really compact

Synchronization bugs in general

- like when you change tabs while on different sections

When maximized it should be visible. Make it top left

Whenever clicking browser action, focus extension

copy to clipboard?

feature to bookmark repos, files, folders

restore from last session would be useful

not sticky is preferable

Clicking between windows should come to the front

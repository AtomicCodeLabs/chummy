# User Feedback

You, the user, drives what new features we will work on next, and that makes your feedback invaluable. The most straightforward way to file a feature/bug ticket is by clicking the Accounts Icon on the left sidebar and clicking the Feedback button.

We are a fairly small team, so we do our best to prioritize which features or bugs to work on. However we make it an effort to respond to all feedback, big and small, so that you are heard.

Are you a coder? If there is a bug or new feature that we aren't getting to quickly enough, feel free to join our open source community. Not a coder? There're many other ways to contribute and we wholeheartedly welcome all kinds of help! The free community version of the extension is completely open-sourced, and provides all sorts of opportunities where you can get involved. Check out our Contributing page for more information.

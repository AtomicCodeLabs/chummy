    <P>
      Our Website offers you the ability to register and login using your
      third-party social media account details (like your Facebook or Twitter
      logins). Where you choose to do this, we will receive certain profile
      information about you from your social media provider. The profile
      Information we receive may vary depending on the social media provider
      concerned, but will often include your name, email address, friends list,
      profile picture as well as other information you choose to make public on
      such social media platform.
    </P>

    <P>
      We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are
      described in this privacy notice or that are otherwise made clear to you
      on the relevant Website. Please note that we do not control, and are not
      responsible for, other uses of your personal information by your
      third-party social media provider. We recommend that you review their
      privacy notice to understand how they collect, use and share your personal
      information, and how you can set your privacy preferences on their sites
      and apps.

        <em>In Short:</em>
      </strong>{' '}
      <em>
        We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the
        purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise required by
        law.
      </em>
    </P>

    <P>
      We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary
      for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention
      period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting or other
      legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping
      your personal information for longer than the period of time in which
      users have an account with us.
    </P>

    <P>
      When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal
      information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if
      this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has
      been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal
      information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is
      possible.

        We aim to protect your personal information through a system of

    </P>

    <P>
      We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security
      measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we
      process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your
      information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information
      storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot
      promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized
      third parties will not be able to defeat our security, and improperly
      collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do
      our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal
      information to and from our Website is at your own risk. You should only
      access the Website within a secure environment.

      If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information,
      you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. Please note
      however that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before
      its withdrawal, nor will it affect the processing of your personal
      information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than
      consent.

    <P>
      Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
      applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can
      activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your

      uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals
      has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser
      signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice
      not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted
      that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice
      in a revised version of this privacy notice.

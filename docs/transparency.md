# Transparency

When installing this extension for the first time, you will be asked to grant the extension the ability to "Read your browsing history." **Chummy does NOT and will NOT track, store, or sell your private information in any shape or form.** In the name of upmost transparency, we've put together a breakdown of exactly how your information is being used in this extension.

The extension's `manifest.json` (see [here](https://github.com/alexkim205/tomaso) in our repository) requests access to two permissions: tabs and storage.





Don't expect this list to grow much even as new features are added because these two permissions encompass the main functionality of the extension already. If we do request additional permissions in the future, we'll be the first to let you know! You can also keep an eye on this page which we'll keep up-to-date.

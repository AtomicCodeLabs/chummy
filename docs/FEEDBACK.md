# User Feedback

Thanks for using Chummy. Your feedback is extremely valuable to us and is what drives what we will work on next. Please check the issues list of our Github repo [here](https://github.com/alexkim205/chummy/issues). The most straightforward way to file a feature/bug ticket is by clicking the Accounts Icon on the left sidebar and clicking the Feedback button.

We are a fairly small team, so we do our best to prioritize which features or bugs to work on. However we make it an effort to respond to all feedback, big and small, so that you are heard.

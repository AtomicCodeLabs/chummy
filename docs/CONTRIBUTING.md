## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the
[Chummy Code of Conduct](https://github.com/alexkim205/chummy/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to chummy@atomiccode.io.

## I Have a Question

> If you want to ask a question, we assume that you have read the available [Documentation](https://github.com/alexkim205/chummy/wiki).

Before you ask a question, it is best to search for existing [Questions](https://github.com/alexkim205/chummy/issues?q=label%3question) that might help you. In case you have found a suitable issue and still need clarification, you can write your question in this issue. It is also advisable to search the internet for answers first.

If you then still feel the need to ask a question and need clarification, we recommend opening a question issue with the [Question Template](https://github.com/alexkim205/chummy/issues/new?assignees=&labels=question&template=question.md&title=%5BQ%5D+).

We will then take care of the issue as soon as possible.

### Reporting Bugs

<!-- omit in toc -->

#### Before Submitting a Bug Report

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Therefore, we ask you to investigate carefully, collect information and describe the issue in detail in your report. Please complete the following steps in advance to help us fix any potential bug as fast as possible.

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Determine if your bug is really a bug and not an error on your side e.g. using incompatible environment components/versions (Make sure that you have read the [documentation](https://github.com/alexkim205/chummy/wiki). If you are looking for support, you might want to check [this section](#i-have-a-question)).
- To see if other users have experienced (and potentially already solved) the same issue you are having, check if there is not already a bug report existing for your bug or error in the [bug tracker](https://github.com/alexkim205/chummy/issues?q=label%3Abug-report).
- Also make sure to search the internet (including Stack Overflow) to see if users outside of the GitHub community have discussed the issue.
- Collect information about the bug:
- Stack trace (Traceback)
- OS, Platform and Version (Windows, Linux, macOS, x86, ARM)
- Version of the extension and browser you're using.
- Possibly your input and the output
- Can you reliably reproduce the issue? And can you also reproduce it with older versions?

#### How Do I Submit a Good Bug Report?

> You must never report security related issues, vulnerabilities or bugs to the issue tracker, or elsewhere in public. Instead sensitive bugs must be sent by email to <chummy@atomiccode.io>.

We use GitHub issues to track bugs and errors. If you run into an issue with the project:

- Open a bug issue using the [Bug Report Template](https://github.com/alexkim205/chummy/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug-report&template=bug.md&title=%5BBUG%5D+). This will automatically be given the `bug-report` label.
- Explain the behavior you would expect and the actual behavior.
- Please provide as much context as possible and describe the _reproduction steps_ that someone else can follow to recreate the issue on their own. This usually includes your code. For good bug reports you should isolate the problem and create a reduced test case.
- Provide the information you collected in the previous section.

Once it's filed:

- The project team will label the issue accordingly.
- A team member will try to reproduce the issue with your provided steps. If there are no reproduction steps or no obvious way to reproduce the issue, the team will ask you for those steps and mark the issue as `needs-repro`. Bugs with the `needs-repro` tag will not be addressed until they are reproduced.
- If the team is able to reproduce the issue, it will be marked `needs-fix`, as well as possibly other tags, and the issue will be left to be [implemented by someone](#your-first-code-contribution).

### Suggesting New Features

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for Chummy, **including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality**. Following these guidelines will help maintainers and the community to understand your suggestion and find related suggestions.

<!-- omit in toc -->

#### Before Submitting a Feature Request

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Read the [documentation](https://github.com/alexkim205/chummy/wiki) carefully and find out if the functionality is already covered, maybe by an individual configuration.
- Perform a [search](https://github.com/alexkim205/chummy/issues?q=label%3Afeature-request) to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.
- Find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to you to make a strong case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature. Keep in mind that we want features that will be useful to the majority of our users and not just a small subset. If you're just targeting a minority of users, consider writing an add-on/plugin library.

<!-- omit in toc -->

#### How Do I Submit a Good Feature Suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/alexkim205/chummy/issues?q=label%3Afeature-request).

Open a feature request issue using the [Feature Request Template](https://github.com/alexkim205/chummy/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feature-request&template=feature-request.md&title=%5BFEAT%5D+). This will automatically be given the `feature-request` label.

## Styleguides

### Linting and Formatting

Eslint and Prettier are used to enforce styling for this project. You don't have to worry about styling for the most part, as both of this tools will be run in a pre-commit hook by Husky during each commit. Check out how the guidelines are configured in `.prettierrc` and `.eslintrc`.

### Commit Messages

Be a good commitzen! This project follows the commit standards that are enforced by [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). You can commit your changes a couple of ways:

- `git commit` - (Recommended) Husky will hook in an interactive interface that will let you choose the type of commit message.
- `npx cz` - Does the same thing as above without running Husky's pre-commit eslint and prettier hooks.

#### Common Types

Please check out the [Conventional Commits Specifications](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for more information about the different commit types and when to use them. The `git commit` method gives you a pretty concise explanation.

- build
- ci
- chore
- docs
- feat (auto bumps MINOR version)
- fix (auto bumps PATCH version)
- perf
- refactor
- revert
- style
- test
- {type}! (appending ! to any type auto bumps MAJOR version)

Examples

```text
feat: added bookmarking page and corresponding store values
fix: fixed random unauth bug
refactor!: drop support for Node 6
```

Check out the [`.commitlintrc.js`](../.commitlintrc.js) file for the full rules configuration.
